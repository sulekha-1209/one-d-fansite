## About

Obsessing over One Direction all over again during quarantine, I thought it would be fun to whip up a website for other fans to discover the fandom. 
This single-page Angular application uses the Spotify API to get the artist information/images and music. 

## Features/Sections

* Song of the Day - Gets a random song from the main One Direction playlist - plays the preview on hover.
* This Day in OneD history - Twitter feed of the famous account of the same name
* Artist profiles - Images and latest songs using the Spotify api + Spotify widget.
* Fan art section - Widget used for images on Instagram tagged #OneDirectionFanArt
* Videos - Youtube playlist embeds for nostalgic videos

Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
Run `ng serve`  for a dev server ( or `npm start` ). Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
